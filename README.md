This repository contains a simple C program that showcases undefined behavior resulting from pointer arithmetic without proper bounds checking. The bug.c file contains the erroneous code, and bugSolution.c provides a corrected version. The core issue revolves around the lack of validation when using pointers, potentially leading to memory corruption and unpredictable behavior. This example serves as a reminder of the importance of careful pointer handling in C programming.
